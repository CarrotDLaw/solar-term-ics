## Chinese Lunar Calendar

Google, Apple, and Microsoft used to provide Chinese Lunar Calendar in iCalendar
format, but most links were died over years. It is become hard to find a usable
Chinese Lunar Calendar for use with online and offline calendar apps.

The Chinese Lunar Calendar is mostly based on the motion of the Moon. It is
said due to the complicate interaction, mostly from the Sun and the Earth, the
motion of Moon is very hard to predict, especially on the long run.  Luckily
[Hong Kong Observatory][HK_Obs] has published a conversion table for the period
from 1901 to 2100. It is the most trustworthy Lunar Calendar I can find on the
web so far.

Lunar calendar beyond 1901-2100 range is generated by finding solar terms and
moon phases uses [VSOP87](ftp://ftp.imcce.fr/pub/ephem/planets/vsop87) planetary
theory and [LEA-406][] lunar theory.

The full version of LEA-406 and VSOP87 are used by default. A truncated version
, aa.py, which is slightly faster, is also included. The accuracy of this
implementation, when compare to the apparent Sun and Moon longitude finded by
the DE431 based JPL Horizon, are showed in following figures:

![aa_full][]
![aa_trunc][]

The lunar calendar generated by the full and truncated version is identical for
the period 1949 - 2100.  There are only two discrepancies compare to the HKO's
version: one is a solar term on 1979-01-20, the other is a new moon on
2057-09-29. It is caused by few seconds of error happens around midnight(UTC
+8).

The official timezone before 1949 is slightly different than the current UTC +8
therefor the computed lunar calendar may not represent history accurately.
